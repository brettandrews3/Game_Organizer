"""
I'm wanting to write a simple program that will catalog my Switch games.
This may end up being based on class inheritance, dictionaries, lists,
or something else. I'll figure it out as I go along.
"""

# Let's try a dictionary first to define the Switch game's components:

game = {
        'Title': 'Name of Game',
        'Publisher': 'Name of Publisher',
        'Format': 'Physical | Digital',
        'Genre': 'Adventure | Platformer | Metroidvania | RPG | Shooter',
        'Own': 'Yes | No',
        'Played': 'Yes | No',
        'Active': 'Yes | No',
        'Finished': 'Yes | No',
        'Review': '1 - 5'
}
print(game)
#TODO: Try adding a game to this list.
